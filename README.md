# Arduino-idea-for-hackathon

Welcome to the Nuclear Narwhals project!



This program was developed on the Arduino Uno and Mega but it is recommedend

that the program is run on the Arduino Mega. Download and run the file 

"Fully_completed_hackathon_code.ino" on your Arduino. Once the program is 

running on your Arduino, you have to open the serial monitor at 9600 baud

rate. Upon opening the monitor you should get a prompt from the

project to hear either a joke, a haiku, or a Badlib 

(Our form of a Madlib). Type in either a "J", a "H", or a "B" to initiate

the laughter! All the other files in this Github are previous nonfunctional

versions and should be treated as such.
